    Add prophecy tiers.
    Divide the Fragments and mapping sections in subsections including:
        Breachstones

        Miscellaneous
    Clean up high-level influenced bases section.

3.9:
    General Changes:   
        Chromatic items are now shown until the end of act 5.
        5-links are now always shown up to end-game before maps instead of up t act 5.
        Changed tier 2 currency shards' sound to better match their cost.
        Jeweller's Orb and Perandus Coins were upped one tier.
        Added blighted maps (somehow missed this on 3.8 lol).
        Added an extra splinter tier to hide the worthless ones later on in the league.
        Now atlas-only bases are shown for all items instead of just jewelry. They can be hidden later on in the league if not on SSF.
        The divination cards section was refactored with less tiers to make it easier to maintain.
        Some divination cards that were missing were added.
        Streamlined the fossils, resonators, incubators, oils and incursion vials sections into the normal currency colors to make them more maintainable and readable in game. Future league sub-currencies should follow this trend as well; barring exceptions like splinters.
    3.9 Changes:
        Updated the maps section in general for 3.9.
        Added all divination cards tiered.
        Changed the old sextant names for the new ones.
        Addded catalysts.
        Added the new Exalted Orbs.
        Added the new fragments.
        Added Awakened gems.
