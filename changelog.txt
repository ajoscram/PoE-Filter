To-Do:
    Update maps section for shaper/elder maps.
    Expand the Influenced base types section with the best bases/levels per influence.

3.9c:
    Split scarabs into their own section.
    Added support for unique watchstones.
    Added economy based prophecy tiers.
    General economy update on all .econ sections (see the list below).
    Fixed a bug where chromatic items would not show up in the first three acts of the game.
    Gave hidden chromatic items a smaller font.
    Added a preface, an index and links to various important resources (and ASCII ART :D).
    Implemented support for PoE Filter Generator.

Filters Folder:
    PoE Generator allows for some very neat sub-filtering.
    Added .chaos rules for: Bodies, Helmets, Gloves, Boots and Weapons.
    Added .econ rules for: fragments, oils, incubator, scarabs, fossils, divination cards and prophecies.
    Added .strict rules where:
        0: Shows everything.
        1: Hides start of the league currency in [0101].
        2: Hides currency that becomes obsolete once quota is met, non-rare atlas bases and non-rare identified items.
        3: Hides worthless currency, white maps, magic jewels and all basic rares except jewellry.
        4: Hides yellow maps, rare jewels, rare jewellry, ID'ed rares and veiled rares.
        5: Hides all red maps except T16s.

3.9b:
    General Changes:
        Fixed the letter color on incubators from grey to black.
        Added Atlas-only base types to the Normal & Magic sections of gear to show them when they have those rarities.
    3.9 Changes:
        Support for "Atlas Region Upgrade Item" (Watchstones) was added.
        Support for new influenced types was added and it was streamlined into a single section alongside Shaper and Elder influence.

3.9:
    General Changes:   
        Chromatic items are now shown until the end of act 5.
        5-links are now always shown up to end-game before maps instead of up to act 5.
        Changed tier 2 currency shards' sound to better match their cost.
        Jeweller's Orb and Perandus Coins were upped one tier.
        Added blighted maps (somehow missed this on 3.8 lol).
        Added an extra splinter tier to hide the worthless ones later on in the league.
        Now atlas-only bases are shown for all items instead of just jewellery. They can be hidden later on in the league if not on SSF.
        The divination cards section was refactored with less tiers to make it easier to maintain.
        Some divination cards that were missing were added.
        Streamlined the fossils, resonators, incubators, oils and incursion vials sections into the normal currency colors to make them more maintainable and readable in game. Future league sub-currencies should follow this trend as well; barring exceptions like splinters.
    3.9 Changes:
        Updated the maps section in general for 3.9.
        Added all divination cards tiered.
        Changed the old sextant names for the new ones.
